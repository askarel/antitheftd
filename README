What is it ?
============

    Many laptops, including the low-end netbooks, incorporate a low to mid-resolution webcam on top of the screen, normally
    used for video chatting. This is just a diverted use of that webcam.

    Antitheftd is an utility that send by e-mail the picture of the unsuspecting curious person that want to have a look
    at the content of the screen of your laptop. It can also be useful in case your laptop get stolen: if the thief is 
    careless, his ugly face will land in your mailbox. 
    
How does it work ?
==================

    Antitheftd is monitoring the lid/screen switch of your computer. Once the lid is open, antitheftd will wait for a small
    (configurable) ammount of time, take a few pictures and finally send them back to you by e-mail.
    
    Antitheftd is built with simplicity in mind: it tries to not duplicate the functions provided by more specialized
    software. It's job is just to monitor the lid switch, take a few pictures and send them to the local SMTP server.
    The handling of the mail afterwards depends of your mail servers configuration and is outside the scope of this script.
    Antitheftd consider it's job done once the pictures are accepted by the local SMTP server.
    
Hardware requirements
=====================
    
    Antitheftd should work on any laptop with a built-in webcam that is supported by the linux kernel.
    The lid switch must also be supported by the linux kernel.
    
Software requirement
====================

    * SMTP 
    -------
        A SMTP server must be running on the laptop.
        
    * mplayer
    ----------
	mplayer is used to dump the video stream from the camera into a bunch of pictures on the local disk
	
    * bsd-mailx
    -----------
	This is a small utility that will be used to create the e-mail with attachements that will be sent to the local 
	SMTP server.

    * mktemp
    ---------
	This small utility safely create temporary files and directories. Should be installed by default on every
	linux distribution

Getting started
===============

    Antitheftd do not require much informations to be usable. At a minimum, you will need to supply a destination e-mail 
    address in the configuration file /etc/antitheftd.conf. A basic config file will look like that:

    DEST_EMAIL=someone@example.com
    
    Other parameters can be changed, see the content of the script for details.
    The local SMTP server configuration will depend of your existing network setup and is outside the scope of this document.
    
    An initscript is provided to automatically start Antitheftd as a background process (start-and-forget)
    
"Approved" configuration
========================

    Antitheftd is working correctly on my Acer Aspire One running Debian "Squeeze". I use Exim4 as a local SMTP server.
    The remote server is running Postfix on Debian "Lenny", with TLS, SASL2 and SMTP AUTH enabled. The port used is port 
    TCP 587 (submission), which is not blocked by any ISP. Exim4 use the remote postfix as a smarthost.
